# Program Information
The program is designed to provide users with information about all 50 US states, including state Capital, Date of Statehood, Population, Motto, flag, Land Mass, Major Industry, Tourist Attractions, and Symbols. This program is accessible via a web page that is designed to be responsive across multiple devices.

## Web Page Development

To develop the web page, the developer utilized LESS to define the main colors used throughout the site, allowing for easy color updates from a central location. Additionally, SCSS was used for the map component, enabling cleaner and more modular code with features like nested styles and variables. Media queries were incorporated to adjust the layout of the page based on screen size, providing optimal viewing on various devices. A hamburger menu was also included for easy navigation on mobile devices using Bootstrap Navigation.

### Design Elements

Bootstrap components were utilized for a cohesive and visually appealing layout. Bootstrap Card was used for each state item, providing a small and unified state. Bootstrap Jumbotron was used to make the heading of the webpage larger and more prominent. Bootstrap Accordion was used for the quiz, providing an engaging way to present questions to users.

### Accessibility Features

To ensure the web page is accessible to a wide range of users, images were given proper alt titles, and semantic tags were used for content. These features enable users with assistive technology, such as screen readers, to easily understand the content.

Overall, the program provides users with a wealth of information about each US state in an accessible and visually engaging manner.
